// Never change following data, data is serialized together with a scene!
// Keep following data same across all of your plugins to V-REP
#define DEVELOPER_DATA_HEADER 34		// Keep always same for all plugins created by you or your company!!!
									// This number identifies data you might save together with scene objects
									// If several developers or companies are using the same number, then
									// data attached to scene objects might not be interpreted correctly.
									// Best is to use the serial number of your first copy of V-REP and
									// always stick to it.
